## ðŸš§ Missing things:

> In order to have solid component in the UI Kit, the following list will help to bring a better abstraction to this component:

- Should probably accept a configuration of action type (primary, secondary, ghost etc)
- Does not display chosen file in any way (path, thumbnail)
- Does not show whether a file was chosen or not
  does not have validation states by itself
- Does not have a design from the design team (task created https://jira.commercetools.com/browse/MC-1958)

# Inputs: File Input

## Usage

```js
import FileInput from '@commercetools-frontend/ui-kit/buttons/file-input';
```

#### Description

File selection inputs are similar to primary action buttons, but they are essentially an input used to select files (e.g to be uploaded) from the user's local machine.

#### Usage

```js
<FileInput allowMultiple={true} onChange={this.handleChange}>
  <FormattedMessage {...messages.uploadImageText} />
</FileInput>
```
